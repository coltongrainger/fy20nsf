What should ask for from the writers of my letters of references? 

- To talk about research ability, work ethic. 
- To credibly support my abilities as I present myself in my personal and research statement. 

GOTO OFFICE HOURS.

For the works cited, pick two very cutting edge citation.

In writing the research statement, avoid acronyms. On the other hand, feel free to include figures, schematics, and aids to comprehension.

For the future career plans section

- lay out future goals in the personal statement
- professor, naval researcher, NASA? (Sounds patriotic.)
- what other possible directions

2/3 of applications are rejected outright.

Include "broader impact" and "purposeful" work.

Look at other examples. <http://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship>
