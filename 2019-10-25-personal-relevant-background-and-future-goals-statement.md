My career goal is to be a research scientist at U.S. national laboratory, focusing on the design of robust mathematical models for complex systems. My immediate goals are

- to build skill as a mathematician by deepening my understanding of statistics, scientific computing, and applied algebraic topology;
- to complete a prototype^[Source code: <https://github.com/NCAR/rda-image-archive>.] of the research data archive image module (`rdaim`) as a student visitor at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR); and
- to develop rigorous, engaging, and inclusive open source curriculum^[E.g., Fall 2019, I am teaching sophomore-level statistics (<https://math2510.coltongrainger.com>) from *OpenIntro Statistics v4.0* (<https://openintro.org>) published in the creative commons (CC BY-SA 3.0).] for lower division undergraduate mathematics courses at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder).
