1. In terms of technical sophistication, my basic computing toolkit includes version control (git, duplicity), high level (R, Python, Haskell) and low level (C++) programming languages, and markup languages (`ipynb`, `Rmd`, XML, HTML, pandoc markdown, \LaTeX). I am accustomed to both Unix-like (MacOS, Ubuntu/Debian) and Windows operating systems. I am comfortable performing computations on the Google Cloud Platform, and I have introductory knowledge of XSEDE science gateways from participating in SGCI webinars.

% might not be the right skills

2. Regarding machine learning: this fall I contributed to CU Boulder's StatOptML (Statistics, Optimization, and Machine Learning) seminar. I applied TDA to consider "is depth needed for deep learning?" following Guss and Salakhutdinov's empirical study [@GS18]. By using persistent homology to catalog feed forward neural architectures, I introduced myself to tensorflow and Ripser, software that I would be enthusiastic to deploy in collaboration with peers and faculty at NCAR. 

% what were the two talks? center my contributions or process around "broadening my knowledge"?

3. Statistical and computational experience would support my career goal to do topological data analysis. There are limited opportunities in my department to train with powerful computational tools. I believe that the NSF GRFP would complement my theoretical strengths, which are afforded to me by my enrollment in a pure mathematics department.

4. In terms of unique contributions to the program: After my undergrad, I took two years to perform stipended service work. For a year in Houston, TX, I developed scalable resources for refugee case management, including a crowd-sourced map of clinics and languages spoken. I wrote bug reports for the implementation three SQL databases, and, when Texas cut funding for Refugee Medical Assistance, I contributed to a data management plan for refugees transitioning from state to federal medical care. For a year in Olympia, WA, I served as a community organizer at a 24/7 homeless shelter. I relied on distributed version control, and became a staunch advocate for deploying "early, often, and with redundant backups". In all, this background experience allows me to contribute to a inclusive research environment. I strive (i) to collaborate, e.g., to focus my effort on tasks where I have a comparative advantage, (ii) to make incremental contributions on the work of others, and (iii) to be transparent, so that others may work off of my contributions.

## Graduate Research Plan Statement

I propose to continue work on the classification and reduction of meteorological data from binary image files (e.g., ship log books) using methods in statistics/machine learning, applied topology, and the digital humanities.

### Which images will be classified?

Ship logs.

### What is the broader impact of reducing meteorological data from these images? 

To uniquely identify records used to construct historical climate models.

### What is the intellectual merit of extending methods from statistics, applied topology, and the digital humanities to do so?

The use of advanced statistics and machine learning in the context of historical climate data is a novel intellectual contribution to the informatics and climate field.
